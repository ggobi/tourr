#' Turnable laser measurements from Bellcore
#'
#'
#' This data came from an investigation of an experimental laser at Bellcore.
#' It was a tunable laser, in the sense that both its wavelength and power
#' output were controllable.
#'
#' Rotation helped the experimental physicists to characterize the laser, which
#' turned out not to be a very good one, due to its unstable operating region.
#'
#' This data initially came to the statistics research group when Janette
#' Cooper asked Paul Tukey to help her analyze the data she had collected to
#' describe the laser.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'  \item ifront, current applied to the front of the laser
#'  \item iback, current applied to the back of the laser

#' Monthly ozone measurements over Central America
#'
#'
#' This data set is a subset of the data from the 2006 ASA Data expo challenge,

#' averages on a very coarse 24 by 24 grid covering Central America, from Jan
#' 1995 to Dec 2000. The data is stored in a 3d area with the first two
#' dimensions representing latitude and longitude, and the third representing

#' Ratings of different locations across North America
#'
#'
#' The "places data" were distribed to interested ASA members a few years ago
#' so that they could apply contemporary data analytic methods to describe
#' these data and then present results in a poster session at the ASA annual
#' conference.  Latitude and longitude have been added by Paul Tukey.
#'
#' ____________________________________________________________________
#'
#' The first dataset is taken from the Places Rated Almanac, by Richard Boyer
#' and David Savageau, copyrighted and published by Rand McNally. This book
#' order (SBN) number is 0-528-88008-X, and it retails for $14.95 .  The data
#' are reproduced on disk by kind permission of the publisher, and with the
#' request that the copyright notice of Rand McNally, and the names of the
#' authors appear in any paper or presentation using these data.
#'
#' The nine rating criteria used by Places Rated Almanac are: Climate and
#' Terrain Housing Health Care and Environment Crime Transportation Education
#' The Arts Recreation Economics
#'
#' For all but two of the above criteria, the higher the score, the better.
#' For Housing and Crime, the lower the score the better.
#'
#' The scores are computed using the following component statistics for each
#' criterion (see the Places Rated Almanac for details):
#'
#' Climate and Terrain: very hot and very cold months, seasonal temperature
#' variation, heating- and cooling-degree days, freezing days, zero-degree
#' days, ninety-degree days.
#'
#' Housing: utility bills, property taxes, mortgage payments.
#'
#' Health Care and Environment: per capita physicians, teaching hospitals,
#' medical schools, cardiac rehabilitation centers, comprehensive cancer
#' treatment centers, hospices, insurance/hospitalization costs index,
#' flouridation of drinking water, air pollution.
#'
#' Crime: violent crime rate, property crime rate.
#'
#' Transportation: daily commute, public transportation, Interstate highways,
#' air service, passenger rail service.
#'
#' Education: pupil/teacher ratio in the public K-12 system, effort index in
#' K-12, accademic options in higher education.
#'
#' The Arts: museums, fine arts and public radio stations, public television
#' stations, universities offering a degree or degrees in the arts, symphony
#' orchestras, theatres, opera companies, dance companies, public libraries.
#'
#' Recreation: good restaurants, public golf courses, certified lanes for
#' tenpin bowling, movie theatres, zoos, aquariums, family theme parks,
#' sanctioned automobile race tracks, pari-mutuel betting attractions, major-
#' and minor- league professional sports teams, NCAA Division I football and
#' basketball teams, miles of ocean or Great Lakes coastline, inland water,
#' national forests, national parks, or national wildlife refuges, Consolidated
#' Metropolitan Statistical Area access.
#'
#' Economics: average household income adjusted for taxes and living costs,
#' income growth, job growth.
