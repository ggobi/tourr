Version 0.6.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two vignettes have been added to help users get started.

Little tour now cycles twice through variable list, in a randomised order.

Two new projection pursuit indexes have ben added, based on function from the archived package mbgraphic.

A slice tour is now available using the function animate_slice(). A new index for searching for interesting slices is available.

A principal component analysis tour display is now available, that renders the axes of the original variables. This requires appropriate scaling of data ahead of time. See the example code.

A new record option is available to print out diagnostic information for every step. Use options(tourr.verbose = TRUE) before beginning to tour. The ferrn package at https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn can be used to diagnose the optimisation techniques.

Improvements to the optimisation functions have been  made: search_better has an interrupt if a higher index is achieved mid-path; search_polish takes a best basis from another routine, and makes small steps to get a very best projection close by.

Set the default fps to 10, to compatibly draw with RStudio window.

Version 0.5.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indexes holes and cmass functions now follow the same style as lda_pp and pda_pp, which means that you need to use them with holes(), and cmass()

A new display type, groupxy has been added, which will run the same tour on subsets of the data in a split plot window

Version 0.5.4.9000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes for R CMD check NOTEs

Version 0.5.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes for R CMD check NOTEs

Version 0.5.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Better rstudio support.

* Removed rggobi from dependencies.

* `display_xy()` gains new edges argument to optionally draw lines between
  specified points.

Version 0.5.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed an error in axis drawing in the desnity tour

* Fixed the calculate of lda_pp when projection dimension is 1

* Changed explanation of proj_dist function

* fix missing export for `proj_dist`

Version 0.5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* minor example fix for ggplot2 0.9 compatibility

* try using `dev.hold()` and `dev.flush()` to see if it improves drawing
  performance. It doesn't seem to on quartz devices.

* `display_density` correctly displays axis labels

Version 0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `cm` was renamed to `cmass`; the dataset sleep was removed

Version 0.4.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `search_geodesic` was passing the wrong parameter to `find_best_dir` causing
  it to search very far away instead of very close, and negatively impacting
  performance (thanks to Mohit Dayal for reporting the bug)

Version 0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* move ggplot2 from depends to suggests
* add CITATION to JSS paper

Version 0.3.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* export `find_platform` function

Version 0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* small fixes for compatibility with the tourrGui package.

tourr 0.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* change documentation file name for `nul` to avoid problems in Windows 7
  (thanks to Brian Ripley)

tourr 0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* many bug fixes in tour algorithms, interpolation and history saving

* `animate` now invisibly returns the bases it displayed when it terminates

* `tourr` now has better NAMESPACE so should play better with other packages

* `display_xy` and `display_dist` do a better at guessing the display
  range

* new `display_trails` rendering

* `display_dist` gains a rug option
